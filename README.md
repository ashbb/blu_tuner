blu tuner
=========

**Blu Tuner** is a tiny Shoes app for [bloopsaphone](http://github.com/mental/bloopsaphone). Let's listen and create **.blu** sounds (some game noises) with Shoes!


**Note**: Shoes (Policeman) includes bloopsaphone. So, you don't need to build and install bloopsaphone by yourself. :)

You can download Shoes from [here](http://shoes.heroku.com/downloads).
